## 1. Introduction

Atmosphere is a real-time streaming data platform that ingests the full Bluesky social network firehose, performs multilingual sentiment analysis, and surfaces live analytics through a public Grafana dashboard.

The thesis of Atmosphere is **"a lot with a little."** Apache Spark serves as the unified engine for ingestion, stream processing, transformation, ML inference, and query serving. Apache Iceberg provides the storage format. Grafana provides the visualization layer. One platform, three technologies — Spark handles all of it.

Two components distinguish Atmosphere from a conventional streaming pipeline:

- **A custom PySpark Structured Streaming data source** that wraps the Bluesky Jetstream WebSocket, implementing the Spark 4.x Python DataSource V2 API. This is a portfolio-grade demonstration of Spark internals knowledge.
- **GPU-accelerated multilingual sentiment analysis** using a transformer model fine-tuned on social media text, running inside a dedicated Spark container with NVIDIA GPU passthrough.

---

## 2. Design Goals and Constraints

### 2.1 Goals

- Ingest the full Bluesky Jetstream firehose (~240 events/sec, all collections) in real time via a custom PySpark WebSocket data source
- Process events through a four-layer medallion architecture (raw → staging → core → mart) using chained Spark Structured Streaming queries
- Perform multilingual sentiment analysis on all posts using a GPU-accelerated transformer model
- Expose live analytics through a Grafana dashboard with 5-second refresh, accessible via a public URL
- Demonstrate that a single platform (Spark) can serve as ingestion engine, stream processor, transformation layer, ML runtime, and query server simultaneously
- Provide a fully reproducible local environment via Docker Compose and a single `make up` command

### 2.2 Scope Boundaries

- Targets single-node local deployment via Docker Compose
- Focuses on aggregate network-level analytics (firehose throughput, sentiment trends, engagement velocity)
- Ingests only publicly available Bluesky data via the Jetstream WebSocket
- Captures live events from the current stream forward; historical coverage grows organically over time
- Schema enforcement is handled inline by Spark transformations

### 2.3 Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| Hardware | 32 GB RAM workstation with NVIDIA GPU, running WSL2 on Linux 5.15 |
| Compute budget | ~24 GB allocated to the Docker stack, ~8 GB reserved for the host workstation |
| Data source | Bluesky Jetstream public WebSocket — zero authentication, zero rate limits, 24-hour event TTL on server |
| Runtime | Always-on operation — the pipeline runs continuously while the workstation remains usable |
| Storage | Local only — RustFS (S3-compatible object storage) running in Docker |
| Network | Outbound WebSocket to Jetstream public instances; inbound via Cloudflare Tunnel for public dashboard access |

### 3.2 Data Flow

All four streaming layers run in a single unified Spark process (`spark-unified`) sharing one SparkSession and JVM:

1. **Ingest layer** connects to the Bluesky Jetstream WebSocket via a custom Python DataSource V2 source. Raw JSON events are written to `atmosphere.raw.raw_events` in 5-second micro-batches.

2. **Staging layer** reads `raw_events` as a streaming Iceberg source. Events are parsed by collection type, fields are extracted and typed, and results are written to six staging tables (`stg_posts`, `stg_likes`, `stg_reposts`, `stg_follows`, `stg_blocks`, `stg_profiles`).

3. **Core layer** reads staging tables and produces enriched core tables: `core_posts` (with extracted hashtags, mentions, content classification), `core_mentions`, `core_hashtags`, and `core_engagement`.

4. **Sentiment layer** reads `core_posts` and applies the XLM-RoBERTa sentiment model via `mapInPandas` with GPU acceleration. Results are written to `core_post_sentiment`.

5. **query-api** exposes all Iceberg tables (raw through mart) as a REST API endpoint. Grafana connects via the Infinity datasource plugin and refreshes panels every 5 seconds.

Additionally, `spark-unified` runs the mart layer as **10 independent streaming queries** (one per materialized mart) that read upstream Iceberg tables with a 1-minute tumbling event-time window and 15-minute watermark, and append pre-aggregated rows to `atmosphere.mart.*`. `mart_pipeline_health` is the only mart that remains a query-time Iceberg view (metadata, not data). Top-N aggregation happens at read time in the Query API — mart tables are append-only. See §5.5.

### 3.3 Technology Choices and Rationale

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Streaming engine | Apache Spark 4.x (Structured Streaming) | Built-in Iceberg support in Spark 4.x. A single engine handles ingestion, transformation, ML inference, and serving — the core thesis of the project. |
| Execution mode | `local[*]` per container | Each Spark application runs in its own container using all available cores. Lightweight, memory-efficient, and sufficient for a single-firehose workload. |
| Table format | Apache Iceberg | ACID transactions, schema evolution, partition evolution, and time travel. Native integration with Spark 4.x. |
| Iceberg catalog | Apache Polaris (REST) | External REST catalog enables clean multi-application table metadata sharing across five Spark containers. Production-standard pattern. |
| Object storage | RustFS | Apache 2.0-licensed, S3-API-compatible object storage. Drop-in replacement for MinIO with active maintenance. Used consistently across the portfolio. |
| Sentiment model | cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment | XLM-RoBERTa fine-tuned on ~198M tweets. Covers 100+ languages including Japanese and Korean — critical for Bluesky's multilingual user base. |
| ML inference | HuggingFace Transformers + `mapInPandas` | Vectorized batch inference via Pandas UDFs. GPU-accelerated with NVIDIA container toolkit. |
| Dashboard | Grafana | Industry-standard observability platform. Infinity datasource plugin connects to the query-api service via REST API. |
| Public access | Cloudflare Tunnel | Secure outbound-only HTTPS tunnel from local machine to public URL. All compute stays local. |
| Container orchestration | Docker Compose | Single `make up` command starts the full stack. |
| Python tooling | uv + pyproject.toml | Modern, fast Python dependency management with lockfile support. |

### 3.4 Consolidated Responsibilities

Spark serves seven distinct roles that are conventionally handled by separate tools:

| Role | How Spark Handles It |
|---|---|
| Message ingestion | Custom DataSource V2 reads directly from the WebSocket |
| Stream processing | Structured Streaming with 5-second micro-batches |
| Scheduling / orchestration | Each application manages its own cadence via `processingTime` triggers |
| SQL transformation | Spark SQL executed as streaming queries within each application |
| Unified batch + stream | A single streaming engine serves both real-time and analytical workloads |
| Data quality | DataFrame assertions inline within streaming transformations |
| Query serving | Query API (FastAPI + PySpark) exposes all tables via REST API |

---

## 4. Data Sources

### 4.1 Bluesky Jetstream WebSocket

Jetstream is a streaming service operated by the Bluesky team that consumes the AT Protocol firehose (`com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos`) and re-emits events as lightweight JSON over WebSocket. It converts the binary CBOR-encoded Merkle Search Tree blocks from the protocol into simple, parseable JSON payloads.

**Connection details:**

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Protocol | WebSocket (WSS) |
| Endpoint | `wss://jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network/subscribe` |
| Authentication | None required |
| Rate limit | None (server caps at 5,000 events/sec per subscriber) |
| Compression | Optional zstd available; plain JSON used (~135 KB/sec, negligible bandwidth) |
| Event TTL | 24 hours on server (PebbleDB storage) |
| Observed throughput | ~240 events/sec (all collections), ~26 posts/sec |

**Public instances:**

| Hostname | Region |
|---|---|
| `jetstream1.us-east.bsky.network` | US-East |
| `jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network` | US-East |
| `jetstream1.us-west.bsky.network` | US-West |
| `jetstream2.us-west.bsky.network` | US-West |

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `wantedCollections` | string (repeatable) | Filter by collection NSID. Supports prefix wildcards (e.g., `app.bsky.feed.*`). Up to 100 collections. |
| `wantedDids` | string (repeatable) | Filter by DID. Up to 10,000 DIDs. |
| `cursor` | integer | Unix microseconds timestamp. Replay events from this point forward (within 24-hour TTL). |
| `maxMessageSizeBytes` | integer | Cap payload size per message. |
| `compress` | boolean | Enable zstd compression (also settable via `Socket-Encoding: zstd` header). |
| `requireHello` | boolean | Pause event delivery until client sends an `options_update` message. |

**Event envelope schema:**

```json
{
  "did": "did:plc:abc123...",
  "time_us": 1712844567890123,
  "kind": "commit",
  "commit": {
    "rev": "3lq2...",
    "operation": "create",
    "collection": "app.bsky.feed.post",
    "rkey": "3lq2abc...",
    "record": { ... },
    "cid": "bafyrei..."
  }
}
```

**Event kinds:**

| Kind | Description | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| `commit` | Record create, update, or delete in a user's repository | ~99% of events |
| `identity` | DID document or handle change | Rare |
| `account` | Account status change (active, deactivated, takendown) | Rare |

Identity and account events are delivered to all subscribers regardless of collection filters.

### 4.2 AT Protocol Collections

The following collections are ingested. Field schemas are derived from the AT Protocol Lexicon definitions.

#### app.bsky.feed.post

Profile update events contain display name, description, avatar, banner, and pinned post references. These are captured at the staging layer; promotion to core and mart layers is planned for a future version.

**Observed collection distribution (500-event sample):**

| Collection | Share |
|---|---|
| app.bsky.feed.like | 66.0% |
| app.bsky.feed.post | 11.2% |

**Partitioning (all core tables):** `PARTITION BY days(event_time)`
**Sort order:** `event_time ASC`

### 5.5 Mart Layer

The mart layer is **ten streaming Iceberg tables** plus one query-time view (`mart_pipeline_health`). Each materialized mart runs as its own Structured Streaming query inside `spark-unified`, reading an upstream Iceberg source, applying a 1-minute tumbling event-time window with a 15-minute watermark, and appending pre-aggregated rows. Dashboards read the mart tables directly; aggregation cost is O(buckets), not O(upstream rows). See `spark/transforms/marts.py` and `docs/mart-sizing-analysis.md`.

**No write-time top-N.** Mart tables store every `(bucket, key)` pair and let the read SQL apply `ORDER BY ... LIMIT N`. This avoids streaming top-N brittleness and keeps mart tables append-only; storage cost is trivial (~16 MB stack-wide for 10 marts × 7 days).

**Materialized tables:**

| Table | Source | Grouping Key | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mart_events_per_second` | `raw.raw_events` | — | Pipeline throughput per 1-minute bucket. |
| `mart_engagement_velocity` | `core.core_engagement` | `event_type` | Likes/reposts/follows per minute, grouped by event type. |
| `mart_sentiment_timeseries` | `core.core_post_sentiment` | `sentiment_label` | Positive/negative/neutral counts per minute. |
| `mart_trending_hashtags` | `core.core_hashtags` | `tag` | Tag counts per minute. Spike ratio computed at read time by `read_trending_hashtags.sql` with `{window}` parameter. |
| `mart_most_mentioned` | `core.core_mentions` | `mentioned_did` | Mention counts per minute per target DID. |
| `mart_language_distribution` | `core.core_posts` | `primary_lang` | Post counts per language per minute. Partitioned `days(bucket_min)` (24-hour retention). |
| `mart_content_breakdown` | `core.core_posts` | `content_type` | Post counts by content type (original/reply/quote) per minute. |
| `mart_embed_usage` | `core.core_posts` | `embed_type` | Post counts by embed type (images/external/record/video) per minute. |
| `mart_firehose_stats` | `raw.raw_events` | `collection` | Per-collection event count + approx unique DIDs (HLL). Feeds the "Total Events" and "Active Users" stat panels. |
| `mart_top_posts` | `core.core_posts ⨝ core.core_post_sentiment` | — | Stream-stream inner join materialized one row per post with text, language, content type, and sentiment scores. |

**Query-time view:**

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| `mart_pipeline_health` | Self-monitoring metrics (events/sec, processing lag, last batch timestamp). Remains an Iceberg view because it is metadata, already <4s warm, and must reflect up-to-the-minute state without watermark delay. Registered by `core.py`. |

**Windowing and triggers:**

- Tumbling window: 1 minute (`bucket_min = window.start`).
- Watermark: 15 minutes on event time.
- Output mode: `append` — closed windows emit once the watermark passes.
- Trigger: `processingTime="5 seconds"` (FR-10 alignment).
- Write sort: `bucket_min DESC` (Iceberg `WRITE ORDERED BY`).

**Mart DDL nullability:** Mart columns are declared without `NOT NULL` because `window.start` and grouping columns read from upstream Iceberg tables are structurally `optional` at the Spark schema level. Iceberg's schema compatibility check rejects writing an optional column into a required one even when the rows are never null in practice. The streaming SQL (not the DDL) is the source of truth for non-null semantics.

### 5.6 Partitioning and Sort Order Strategy

| Layer | Partition Scheme | Sort Order | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw | `days(ingested_at), collection` | `ingested_at` | Day + collection pruning. Collection as secondary partition skips irrelevant event types on filtered reads. |
| Staging | `days(event_time)` | `event_time` | Daily partitions. Collection-level separation is handled by having one table per collection. |
| Core | `days(event_time)` | `event_time` | Consistent with staging. Time-range queries are the primary access pattern. |
| Mart (materialized) | `hours(bucket_min)` for time-series marts; `days(bucket_min)` for `mart_language_distribution`; unpartitioned for small key-lookup marts (`trending_hashtags`, `most_mentioned`, `content_breakdown`, `embed_usage`) | `bucket_min DESC` | Time-series marts partition by hour so dashboard time-range scans touch 1 manifest per hour. Small key-lookup marts stay unpartitioned — they are tiny enough (≤ a few MB) that partitioning adds manifest overhead without pruning benefit. |

Data retention is set to **30 days** across all layers. Expired partitions are dropped by a maintenance routine.

**Total memory allocation: ~22 GB** (within 24 GB budget, leaving ~1.7 GB headroom for JVM overhead and OS caches).

### 6.2 Startup Dependency Chain

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PG[postgres] --> PL[polaris]
    RS[rustfs] --> INIT[init]
    PL --> INIT
    INIT --> SU[spark-unified]
    INIT --> QA[query-api]
    QA --> GF[grafana]
    GF --> CF[cloudflared]
```

Containers use Docker Compose `depends_on` with health checks to enforce ordering. The `init` container exits after setup; all other containers run continuously with `restart: unless-stopped`.

### 6.3 Docker Networking

| Network | Purpose | Members |
|---|---|---|
| `atmosphere-data` | Internal data plane. All storage and compute traffic. | rustfs, polaris, postgres, init, spark-unified, query-api |
| `atmosphere-frontend` | Serving plane. Dashboard and public access. | query-api, grafana, cloudflared |

`query-api` is connected to both networks — it reads from storage on the data network and serves queries to Grafana on the frontend network.

### 6.4 Init Service

The init container performs three setup tasks and exits:

1. **RustFS bucket creation** — creates the `warehouse` bucket for Iceberg data files.
2. **Polaris warehouse creation** — registers the `atmosphere` warehouse in the Polaris REST catalog.
3. **Iceberg namespace creation** — creates four namespaces: `atmosphere.raw`, `atmosphere.staging`, `atmosphere.core`, `atmosphere.mart`.

Each Spark application creates its own tables on first write using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` semantics. The init service handles only infrastructure-level setup.

### 6.5 Volume Mounts

| Volume | Container(s) | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rustfs-data` | rustfs | `/data` | Persistent object storage |
| `postgres-data` | postgres | `/var/lib/postgresql/data` | Catalog metadata |
| `spark-checkpoints` | spark-unified | `/opt/spark/checkpoints` | Streaming checkpoint state (subdirs: ingest-raw, staging, core/posts, core/engagement, sentiment) |
| `grafana-data` | grafana | `/var/lib/grafana` | Dashboard state and plugin cache |

## 7. Custom WebSocket Data Source

### 7.1 Design Rationale

Atmosphere implements a custom PySpark Structured Streaming data source that reads directly from the Jetstream WebSocket. Spark ingests the firehose as a first-class streaming source with full offset tracking and checkpoint integration.

This design choice serves two purposes:

1. **Architectural simplicity** — a single-source, single-consumer pipeline benefits from the fewest possible components. Direct WebSocket ingestion keeps the architecture to Spark, Iceberg, and Grafana.
2. **Portfolio signal** — implementing a DataSource V2 provider demonstrates deep knowledge of Spark internals, specifically the streaming source contract, offset management, and micro-batch lifecycle.

### 7.2 Python DataSource V2 API

Spark 4.x introduces a Python-native DataSource API for implementing custom sources entirely in Python. The implementation consists of two classes:

**`JetstreamDataSource(DataSource)`** — registered with Spark as a named data source. Provides factory methods for creating readers.

**`JetstreamStreamReader(SimpleStreamReader)`** — manages the WebSocket connection and yields event batches to Spark on each micro-batch trigger. Implements the following contract:

| Method | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `initialOffset()` | Returns the starting offset. Uses the current time in microseconds to begin capturing live events. |
| `read(start)` | Called by Spark on each micro-batch. Returns `(rows, offset)` — the batch of events since `start` and the new offset position. |
| `commit(end)` | Called after a micro-batch is successfully committed. Persists the offset for cursor-based reconnection. |
| `schema()` | Returns the output schema — matches the `raw_events` table structure. |

### 7.3 Connection Lifecycle

1. **Connect** — the reader opens a WebSocket to `wss://jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network/subscribe` requesting all collections.
2. **Buffer** — incoming events are buffered in memory between `read()` calls. The buffer is bounded (configurable, default 50,000 events) to provide backpressure.
3. **Yield** — on each `read()` call, the buffer is drained and returned as a batch of rows. The latest `time_us` value becomes the new offset.
4. **Reconnect** — on disconnect, the reader reconnects with `?cursor={last_time_us - 5_000_000}` (5-second buffer) to ensure gapless recovery within Jetstream's 24-hour event TTL.

### 7.4 Offset Tracking

Offset tracking uses a dual mechanism:

- **Spark checkpoint** — Spark's built-in checkpoint system persists the offset returned by `read()` to a named Docker volume. On container restart, Spark recovers the last committed offset automatically.
- **Jetstream cursor** — the `cursor` query parameter allows the WebSocket to replay events from a specific microsecond timestamp. The reader uses the last committed `time_us` (minus a 5-second safety buffer) as the cursor on reconnection.

This dual approach ensures that transient disconnects, container restarts, and full stack restarts all recover cleanly within Jetstream's 24-hour retention window.

### 7.5 Micro-batch Boundary Logic

The streaming query is configured with `trigger(processingTime="5 seconds")`. On each trigger:

1. Spark calls `read(start_offset)`.
2. The reader drains all buffered events received since the last call.
3. Events are returned as a DataFrame with the `raw_events` schema.
4. Spark writes the batch to `atmosphere.raw.raw_events` via the Iceberg sink.
5. On commit, `commit(end_offset)` is called — the reader updates its internal cursor.

At ~240 events/sec, each 5-second batch contains approximately 1,200 events (~340 KB). This volume fits comfortably within Spark's single-partition processing capacity.

### 7.6 Error Handling and Backpressure

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| WebSocket disconnect | Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s). Reconnect uses cursor for gapless recovery. |
| Buffer overflow | If the buffer exceeds its capacity between `read()` calls, the oldest events are evicted and a warning is logged. At normal throughput and 5-second triggers, the buffer operates well within capacity. |
| Jetstream server error | Failover to an alternate public instance (e.g., `jetstream1.us-east.bsky.network`). |
| Spark micro-batch failure | Spark retries the batch from the last committed offset. The WebSocket buffer continues accumulating independently. |
| Malformed JSON | Malformed events are logged and skipped. The `raw_json` column stores the original payload for debugging. |

## 8. ML / Sentiment Analysis

### 8.1 Model Selection

The sentiment model is **cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment**, an XLM-RoBERTa model fine-tuned on approximately 198 million tweets for three-class sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Architecture | XLM-RoBERTa (cross-lingual transformer) |
| Training data | ~198M tweets |
| Languages | 100+ (including English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, German, French) |
| Output classes | `positive`, `negative`, `neutral` |
| Model size | ~1.1 GB |
| Max input length | 512 tokens (sufficient for Bluesky's 300-grapheme post limit) |

Bluesky's user base is multilingual — Japanese constitutes approximately 26% of posts in observed samples. This model provides sentiment coverage across all languages in a single forward pass, including English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, German, and French.

### 8.2 Inference Pipeline

The sentiment layer (within spark-unified) runs a Spark Structured Streaming query that:

1. Reads `atmosphere.core.core_posts` as a streaming Iceberg source.
2. Applies the sentiment model via `mapInPandas`, a Pandas UDF that processes batches of rows as Pandas DataFrames.
3. Writes results to `atmosphere.core.core_post_sentiment`.

The `mapInPandas` pattern is chosen over scalar UDFs because it enables vectorized batch inference — the HuggingFace pipeline processes multiple texts in a single forward pass, maximizing GPU utilization.

```python
def predict_sentiment(batches: Iterator[pd.DataFrame]) -> Iterator[pd.DataFrame]:
    model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis",
                     model="cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment",
                     device=0,  # GPU
                     batch_size=64)
    for batch in batches:
        results = model(batch["text"].tolist(), truncation=True)
        batch["sentiment_label"] = [r["label"] for r in results]
        batch["sentiment_confidence"] = [r["score"] for r in results]
        # ... expand to positive/negative/neutral scores
        yield batch
```

The model is loaded once per Python worker process and reused across all batches within the partition. Spark's `mapInPandas` guarantees that the iterator is consumed sequentially within a single process, so the model remains in GPU memory for the lifetime of the streaming query.

### 8.3 GPU Acceleration

| Component | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Host requirement | NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support, `nvidia-container-toolkit` installed |
| Docker runtime | `nvidia` runtime specified in `docker-compose.yml` |
| Base image | `nvidia/cuda:12.x-runtime` with Spark 4.x and Python 3.11 |
| Device access | `deploy.resources.reservations.devices: [capabilities: [gpu]]` |
| PyTorch | CPU+CUDA build (`torch` with CUDA 12.x) |
| HuggingFace | `transformers` + `accelerate` libraries |

The model is downloaded during Docker image build (`RUN python -c "from transformers import pipeline; pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model='cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment')"`) and embedded in the image for instant startup and reproducible builds.

### 8.4 Batching Strategy

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| HuggingFace `batch_size` | 64 | Balances GPU memory usage against throughput. XLM-RoBERTa with batch=64 fits comfortably in 8 GB VRAM. |
| Spark `mapInPandas` batch size | Spark default (Arrow batch size) | Spark controls how many rows are sent to each `mapInPandas` call. The HuggingFace pipeline internally sub-batches at 64. |
| Trigger interval | 5 seconds | Aligned with upstream core layer. At ~26 posts/sec, each batch contains ~130 posts — a single GPU forward pass completes in <1 second. |

**Throughput estimate:** At batch_size=64, XLM-RoBERTa on a consumer NVIDIA GPU processes approximately 200-500 texts/sec. At ~26 posts/sec inbound, the GPU is utilized at 5-13% — substantial headroom for peak hours.

### 8.5 GPU Fallback

The container detects GPU availability at startup via `torch.cuda.is_available()`. When running on CPU (e.g., during development on a different machine), the pipeline sets `device=-1` in the HuggingFace pipeline. CPU throughput is approximately 5-15 texts/sec — sufficient for development and testing workflows.

### 8.6 Output Schema

The sentiment output enriches each post with five additional columns:

| Column | Type | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sentiment_positive` | FLOAT | 0.0–1.0 | Model's positive class probability. |
| `sentiment_negative` | FLOAT | 0.0–1.0 | Model's negative class probability. |
| `sentiment_neutral` | FLOAT | 0.0–1.0 | Model's neutral class probability. |
| `sentiment_label` | STRING | `positive`, `negative`, `neutral` | Argmax of the three scores. |
| `sentiment_confidence` | FLOAT | 0.33–1.0 | Score of the dominant label. |

The three probability scores sum to 1.0 for each post. The `sentiment_label` is the class with the highest probability, and `sentiment_confidence` is that probability value.

---

## 9. Serving and Interfaces

### 9.1 Query API

The `query-api` container runs a custom FastAPI application backed by PySpark in `local[*]` mode. It exposes all Iceberg tables across all four namespaces as queryable resources via a REST API that returns JSON.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Protocol | HTTP/REST (JSON) |
| Port | 8000 |
| Framework | FastAPI + PySpark |
| Authentication | None (local network only) |
| Catalog | Polaris REST catalog (`atmosphere`) |
| Health check | HTTP GET to `/health` |
| Concurrent queries | Limited by `local[*]` parallelism — sufficient for a single Grafana instance |

**Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | Health check — returns service status |
| `/api/marts` | GET | Lists available mart tables and views |
| `/api/mart/{name}` | GET | Returns data from a named mart table or view |
| `/api/sql` | POST | Executes an arbitrary SQL query against Iceberg tables |

### 9.2 Grafana Connection

Grafana connects to the query-api service using the **Infinity datasource plugin** (`yesoreyeram-infinity-datasource`), which issues HTTP requests and parses JSON responses.

**Data source configuration:**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Plugin | Infinity (`yesoreyeram-infinity-datasource`) |
| Base URL | `http://query-api:8000` |
| Auth | Anonymous |

All dashboard panels issue SQL queries against Iceberg tables via this connection. Panels refresh every 5 seconds, aligned with the upstream micro-batch trigger interval.

### 9.3 Cloudflare Tunnel

The `cloudflared` container establishes an outbound-only HTTPS tunnel to the Cloudflare network, making the local Grafana instance accessible at a public URL.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Tunnel type | Named tunnel (persistent) |
| Protocol | QUIC (with HTTP/2 fallback) |
| Origin service | `http://grafana:3000` |
| Public hostname | Configured via Cloudflare dashboard (e.g., `atmosphere.yourdomain.com`) |
| Authentication | Cloudflare Access (optional — can restrict to specific emails or allow public) |

**Requirements:**
- A registered domain (~$10/year) with DNS managed by Cloudflare (free plan)
- A Cloudflare Tunnel token (generated via `cloudflared tunnel create`)
- The token is provided to the container via the `TUNNEL_TOKEN` environment variable

### 9.4 Public URL Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Local Machine
        GF[Grafana :3000]
        CF[cloudflared]
    end

    subgraph Cloudflare Edge
        CE[Cloudflare\nEdge Network]
    end

    subgraph Visitor
        BR[Browser]
    end

    GF --> CF
    CF -->|QUIC tunnel\noutbound only| CE
    BR -->|HTTPS| CE
```

All data processing remains local. Only rendered dashboard HTML/JSON travels through the tunnel.

---

## 10. Dashboard Design

### 10.1 Panel Layout

The Grafana dashboard is organized into five horizontal rows, each targeting a distinct analytical domain. All panels share a common time range selector and auto-refresh at 5-second intervals.

### 10.2 Row 1: Sentiment Live Feed

| Panel | Type | Query Source |
|---|---|---|
| Rolling Sentiment Score | Time series | `mart_sentiment_timeseries` — positive/negative/neutral averages over 1-minute windows |
| Current Sentiment Gauge | Gauge | `mart_sentiment_timeseries` — latest 5-second window average |
| Top 5 Most Positive Posts | Table | `mart_top_posts` view — ORDER BY sentiment_positive DESC LIMIT 5 |
| Top 5 Most Negative Posts | Table | `mart_top_posts` view — ORDER BY sentiment_negative DESC LIMIT 5 |

### 10.3 Row 2: Firehose Activity

| Panel | Type | Query Source |
|---|---|---|
| Events/sec by Collection | Stacked area chart | `mart_events_per_second` — time series grouped by collection |
| Operations Breakdown | Time series | `mart_events_per_second` — create/update/delete over time |
| Unique Users (5-min window) | Stat | `mart_events_per_second` — distinct DID count |
| Total Event Counter | Stat | `mart_events_per_second` — cumulative sum |

### 10.4 Row 3: Language & Content

| Panel | Type | Query Source |
|---|---|---|
| Language Distribution | Pie chart | `mart_language_distribution` view — top 10 languages + "other" |
| Post Type Ratio | Bar chart | `mart_content_breakdown` view — original vs. reply over time |
| Embed Usage | Bar chart | `mart_content_breakdown` view — text-only vs. images vs. links vs. quotes vs. video |
| Trending Hashtags | Table | `mart_trending_hashtags` — top-N with current count, baseline count, spike ratio |

### 10.5 Row 4: Engagement Velocity

| Panel | Type | Query Source |
|---|---|---|
| Likes per Second | Time series | `mart_engagement_velocity` — likes/sec over rolling windows |
| Reposts per Second | Time series | `mart_engagement_velocity` — reposts/sec over rolling windows |
| Follow/Unfollow Rate | Time series | `mart_engagement_velocity` — net follow rate |
| Most Mentioned Accounts | Table | `mart_most_mentioned` view — top 20 DIDs by mention count |

### 10.6 Row 5: Pipeline Health

| Panel | Type | Query Source |
|---|---|---|
| Events Ingested/sec | Time series | `mart_pipeline_health` — ingestion throughput |
| Processing Lag | Time series | `mart_pipeline_health` — `current_time - max(event_time)` per container |
| Last Batch Timestamp | Table | `mart_pipeline_health` — per-container last successful batch time |
| Memory/CPU (if instrumented) | Time series | Docker metrics (optional) |

### 10.7 Provisioning

All dashboard configuration is committed to the repository as code:

- `grafana/provisioning/datasources/infinity.yml` — auto-configures the Infinity data source pointing to `http://query-api:8000`
- `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboard.yml` — dashboard provisioning configuration
- `grafana/dashboards/atmosphere.json` — complete dashboard definition (panels, queries, layout)

The dashboard is fully functional on first `docker compose up`.

---

## 11. Error Handling and Resilience

### 11.1 WebSocket Disconnect Recovery

The custom data source implements automatic reconnection with the following strategy:

1. On disconnect, log the event and the last known `time_us` offset.
2. Wait with exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s (capped).
3. Reconnect to the Jetstream endpoint with `?cursor={last_time_us - 5_000_000}` (5-second overlap).
4. If the primary endpoint fails after 3 attempts, failover to an alternate public instance.
5. Deduplicate overlapping events downstream (staging layer deduplicates on `did + rkey + time_us`).

### 11.2 Spark Checkpoint Guarantees

Each Spark Structured Streaming query writes checkpoint data to a named Docker volume. Checkpoints include:

- **Offset log** — tracks which offsets have been committed.
- **Commit log** — records successfully written micro-batches.
- **State store** — persists stateful operations (watermarks, aggregations).

On container restart, Spark reads the checkpoint and resumes from the last committed offset, providing exactly-once semantics within the Spark checkpoint boundary.

### 11.3 Container Restart Policies

All long-running containers are configured with `restart: unless-stopped`. The `init` container uses `restart: "no"` — it exits after setup completes.

Health checks are defined for critical services:

| Container | Health Check |
|---|---|
| rustfs | HTTP GET to health endpoint |
| polaris | HTTP GET to `/api/v1/config` |
| postgres | `pg_isready` |
| query-api | HTTP GET to `/health` on port 8000 |
| grafana | HTTP GET to `/api/health` |

### 11.4 Stale Data Handling

If the spark-unified process stops or a streaming query falls behind, Grafana continues to display the last known data. Dashboard panels show stale timestamps rather than empty panels. The Pipeline Health row (§10.6) surfaces lag metrics so the operator can identify which layer is behind.

### 11.5 GPU Fallback

The sentiment layer detects GPU availability at startup:

```python
device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1
```

The layer adapts automatically at startup — GPU when available, CPU otherwise. CPU inference is sufficient for development and testing workflows.

## 13. Testing and Quality Assurance

Formal test suites and data quality frameworks are deferred to a post-MVP phase. During development, the following informal validation approach is used:

### 13.1 Smoke Tests

- **Ingestion health:** Verify `raw_events` row count increases steadily by querying via the query-api service: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atmosphere.raw.raw_events WHERE ingested_at > current_timestamp - INTERVAL 1 MINUTE`.
- **Staging completeness:** Verify all six staging tables receive data: `SELECT 'stg_posts' AS tbl, COUNT(*) FROM atmosphere.staging.stg_posts UNION ALL ...`.
- **Sentiment coverage:** Verify `core_post_sentiment` rows align with `core_posts`: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atmosphere.core.core_post_sentiment WHERE event_time > current_timestamp - INTERVAL 5 MINUTES`.

### 13.2 Data Spot-Checks

- Compare raw JSON payloads against staging column values for a sample of events.
- Verify sentiment labels are reasonable by inspecting posts with extreme positive/negative scores.
- Confirm hashtag and mention extraction by comparing `core_hashtags` entries against `facets_json` in `stg_posts`.

### 13.3 Pipeline Health Monitoring

The `mart_pipeline_health` table and corresponding Grafana dashboard row (§10.6) provide continuous self-monitoring. Processing lag exceeding 30 seconds indicates a bottleneck in the streaming chain.

---

## 14. Deployment Strategy

### 14.1 Local Development

The full stack starts with a single command:

```bash
make up
```

This executes `docker compose up -d` with the appropriate profiles and environment variables. The Makefile provides additional targets:

| Target | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `make up` | `docker compose up -d` | Start all containers |
| `make down` | `docker compose down` | Stop all containers |
| `make logs` | `docker compose logs -f` | Tail all container logs |
| `make status` | `docker compose ps` | Show container status |
| `make clean` | `docker compose down -v` | Stop and remove all volumes (full reset) |

On first run, the `init` container creates the necessary infrastructure (buckets, catalog, namespaces), then exits. Subsequent `make up` invocations skip initialization (idempotent checks).

### 14.2 Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

**Prerequisites:**
1. A registered domain with DNS managed by Cloudflare (free plan).
2. A Cloudflare Tunnel created via `cloudflared tunnel create atmosphere`.
3. The tunnel token stored in `.env` as `TUNNEL_TOKEN`.
4. A DNS CNAME record pointing `atmosphere.yourdomain.com` to the tunnel ID.

**Container configuration:**

```yaml
cloudflared:
  image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
  command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run
  environment:
    - TUNNEL_TOKEN=${TUNNEL_TOKEN}
  networks:
    - atmosphere-frontend
  depends_on:
    grafana:
      condition: service_healthy
  restart: unless-stopped
```

The tunnel ingress routes all traffic to the local Grafana instance at `http://grafana:3000`.

### 14.3 Grafana Cloud Alternative

Grafana Cloud's free tier (10,000 series, 50 GB logs) is a potential alternative to self-hosting. The Infinity datasource plugin would connect to the query-api service via the Cloudflare Tunnel — all compute stays local, and Grafana Cloud handles rendering and public access.

This option is documented for future investigation. The initial deployment uses self-hosted Grafana with Cloudflare Tunnel.

---

## 15. Design Decisions

### 15.1 Direct WebSocket ingestion

The Jetstream WebSocket is a single-source, single-consumer stream. Jetstream provides cursor-based replay with 24-hour retention, and the pipeline has a single consumer (Spark). Spark ingests directly from the WebSocket via a custom data source, keeping the architecture to the fewest possible moving parts.

### 15.2 Custom DataSource V2 for ingestion

The DataSource V2 API integrates natively with Spark's offset and checkpoint machinery, providing exactly-once guarantees within the streaming contract. It manages the WebSocket connection lifecycle, offset tracking, and micro-batch boundaries as a first-class Spark citizen — the same contract used by Kafka and Iceberg sources.

### 15.3 Unified streaming process with separate query serving

The four streaming layers (ingest, staging, core, sentiment) run in a single `spark-unified` container sharing one SparkSession and JVM. A separate `query-api` container provides REST API access to all Iceberg tables for Grafana. This separation keeps the streaming workload isolated from query serving while minimizing container count and memory overhead.

### 15.4 Adaptive GPU/CPU inference

The XLM-RoBERTa model runs on GPU when available (`device=0`) and adapts to CPU (`device=-1`). GPU provides headroom for peak throughput; CPU is sufficient for development and testing. The pipeline adapts automatically at startup via `torch.cuda.is_available()`.

### 15.5 Vectorized batch inference via mapInPandas

`mapInPandas` processes entire partitions as Pandas DataFrames, enabling the HuggingFace pipeline to batch multiple texts into a single forward pass. A batch_size of 64 achieves 10-50x throughput compared to single-text inference, maximizing GPU utilization.

### 15.6 Centralized REST catalog (Polaris)

The spark-unified process and query-api service read and write table metadata concurrently. The Polaris REST catalog serializes all metadata operations through a single service, providing clean multi-process coordination. Both processes share a consistent view of table state.

### 15.7 Fully materialized mart layer

All 10 analytics marts are materialized as streaming Iceberg tables with 1-minute tumbling windows and 15-minute watermarks. This replaces the earlier hybrid design (5 materialized + 4 views) after the pre-materialization baseline in `docs/mart-sizing-analysis.md` showed every view-based mart except `pipeline_health` exceeded the <5s dashboard-read SLA (warm latencies 16–22s, cold 20–88s). `pipeline_health` remains a query-time view because it is already <4s warm and must reflect up-to-the-minute state without watermark delay. Top-N aggregation (e.g. `ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 20` for trending hashtags) is applied at read time in the Query API rather than at write time, which avoids streaming top-N brittleness and keeps mart tables append-only. Storage cost is trivial (~16 MB stack-wide for 10 marts × 7 days).

### 15.8 Iceberg compaction endpoint

Streaming writes produce many small files (baseline: ~60 k files across ~1.1 GB under steady state, 17–37 KB avg). The Query API exposes `GET /api/maintenance/table-stats` and `POST /api/maintenance/run` to report per-table state and trigger compaction (`rewrite_data_files` + `expire_snapshots`) inside the query-api SparkSession. Threshold: `file_count > 500 OR avg_file_kb < 30`. Per-table 10-minute rate limit prevents thrashing. Snapshot retention: 1 day. `min-input-files=2` override ensures small mart tables with 2–4 files still get compacted; `partial-progress.enabled=true` keeps a single file-group failure on large raw/staging tables from rolling back the whole rewrite. See `reference/iceberg-maintenance-procedures.md`.

### 15.8 30-day retention window

Thirty days of data enables monthly trend analysis with manageable storage. At ~240 events/sec, 30 days produces approximately 622 million raw events. Iceberg's columnar Parquet storage and partition pruning keep time-bounded dashboard queries in sub-second response times.

### 15.9 Append-only event model

All events — including deletes (3.4% of observed traffic) — are captured in raw and staging layers. Mart-layer aggregations count only create and update operations. The original content was public when posted; the full event history is preserved for audit and analysis.

### 15.10 Plain JSON WebSocket transport

Jetstream supports zstd compression with a custom dictionary (~56% size reduction). The pipeline uses plain JSON because uncompressed throughput is ~135 KB/sec — negligible bandwidth — and plain JSON keeps the ingestion hot path simple and dependency-free.

### 15.11 Build-time model embedding

The XLM-RoBERTa model (~1.1 GB) is downloaded during `docker build` and embedded in the image. This ensures reproducible builds and instant container startup with zero runtime network dependencies. The resulting image (~6 GB with CUDA + model) is built once and cached.

### 15.12 Spark 4.x local[*] mode

Spark 4.x includes built-in Iceberg support, the Python DataSource V2 API, and improved streaming performance. `local[*]` mode runs the unified application using all available CPU cores — lightweight, memory-efficient, and purpose-fit for a single-firehose workload.
